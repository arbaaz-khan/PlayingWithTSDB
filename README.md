# PlayingWithTSDB
There are many types of databases, depending on the requirement we choose the suitable database for our application or project.
Sometimes we need to store a massive amount of data coming out of a source. This is a scenario which can be handled by TSDB(Time Series Database). 
There are many options available those serve this purpose, InfluxDB,Prometheus,TimeScale are few among them. Here, I have explained about InfluxDB and how to get started with it.
We will also be building a client that would be pushing the data to the TSDB continuously.
Hope this will be interesting.
